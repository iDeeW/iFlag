Want To Help?
=============

These are the various ways how you can aid the project and help its further development.


A. Please Donate
----------------

The easiest way to help is to simply __donate money__
via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=AXVXCF5T3M2GS&item_name=iFLAG&currency_code=USD&source=url)
to keep the project up and running.

Thank you so much in advance!

Countless hours go into the development and especially testing,
so if you'd perhaps like to appreciate latest update,
or use more than one device,
or are using the device to make profit (use in broadcasts, selling the units, ...),
you should probably consider a reasonably proportional donation.

Or, perhaps everytime _iFLAG_ helps to prevent some on-track mishap put a coin in a jar.
When the jar gets heavy just transfer the funds to me
via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=AXVXCF5T3M2GS&item_name=iFLAG&currency_code=USD&source=url) ;)


B. Help Promote
---------------

Spread the word :)

You can also put ___iFLAG_ logo on your car__. I hereby give permission to anyone to do that.
The larger the logo, the better :) If you do so, please share a shot with the community
in the [forum thread](http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/0/3341549.page).

C. Help Experiment
------------------

Activate __Experimental Updates__ in the Options
to receive and test feature updates before
anyone else on the stable non-experimental channel.
Run the new feature(s) through its paces.

You can always deactivate these updates
and the updater will restore the stable version for you.


D. Report Bugs
--------------

If you spot anything not working as you would expect,
please report to me via iRacing PM (Petr Vostrel) or by email (`petr at vostrel dot cz`).
Thank you very much!


E. Help Test
------------

From time to time, some features and fixes need to be validated on the track and for that
someone else either needs to test with me in a hosted session or needs to test a scenario
by himself especially in dirt and oval conditions.

If you'd like to __volunteer as a tester__, in exchange of pre-release software
please get in touch with me via iRacing PM (Petr Vostrel) or by email (`petr at vostrel dot cz`).


F. Help Code
------------

As _iFLAG_ is an open source project,
I will warmly welcome anyone willing to contribute
their coding skills and expand on the existing codebase
and work together for the benefit of the entire _iFLAG_ community.

If you are able to code, especially C#,
have attention to detail
and understand the current code,
please get in touch with me via iRacing PM (Petr Vostrel) or by email (`petr at vostrel dot cz`).
