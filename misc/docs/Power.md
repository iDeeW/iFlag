Power
=====


There are no measurable or visible gains in using an external power source of any voltage or amperage.
The unit consumes 260mA at peak brightness, so USB port capable of providing stable 400mA is good enough
for the job alone and often far more reliable than the external power circuit.

All in all, do not use any external power source and simply ignore the DC jack plug of the Arduino.


Power Consumption
-----------------

Following table is for illustration purposes only. It contains bench measurements of power draw on various voltages and has been measured on Funduino Uno clone.

| DC Voltage | Full Draw | Idle Draw |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| 7V         |     260mA |      85mA |
| 8V         |     260mA |      99mA |
| 9V         |     260mA |      99mA |
| 10V        |     260mA |      99mA |
| 11V        |     260mA |      99mA |
| 12V        |     260mA |      99mA |
